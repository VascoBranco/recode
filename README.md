# recode - Relational Ecological COrpus for Data Extraction

RECODE is a manually annotated corpus of ecological and taxonomic literature, aimed at training and fine-tuning models for automated extraction of occurrence and trait data from unstructured text. This repository is a reference point for the many volunteers both students and experts that have provided us with annotated data.
