# recode

RECODE is a manually annotated corpus of ecological and taxonomic literature, aimed at training and fine-tuning models for automated extraction of occurrence and trait data from unstructured text. Documents present have been annotated and validated by experts familiar with the traits of the included taxa (currently spiders and insects). Furthermore, this dataset is goal-oriented and published simultaneously with a complementary R package (arete) and a practical case of its usage for both finetuning and validation.
